Project to get more used to deep learning; it heavily relies on the tensor flow library.

The file named "build_model" sets up a pipeline to read in the seperated data sets, sets up and trains the model, graphs the training progress of loss data, and saves the model.

To run the file mentioned above, a "raw_data" folder needs to be in same directory with the seperated data in it. That same filepath needs to be defined in the program as well.
